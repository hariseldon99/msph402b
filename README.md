MSPH402B
============================================

Python codes for MSPH402B - Computational Physics, taught at the Department of Physics, The University of Burdwan


A repository of all my codes and simulations used to teach [Computational Physics](https://bit.ly/mphys0402b) to masters students at the 
[Department of Physics](https://sites.google.com/a/phys.buruniv.ac.in/physics/) in [The University of Burdwan](https://www.buruniv.ac.in/)

The simulations are written in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

Instructions
=========================
You can run these python codes by installing the requisite software in your computer, or online through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


1. In order to run these programs in your computer, perform the following steps.
    * Download this repository by cloning it (see [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)  for this).
    * Download and install the anaconda python distribution (anaconda @ https://www.anaconda.com/). Also, see [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) on how to install anaconda.
    * On Android devices, you can install pydroid instead. See [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnr4iZRtfbx4LQ2d7Cl3fOdQ6Utb80zI/view?usp=sharing) for details. 
            
2. For a quick introduction to the Python programming language, as well as [Numerical Python](https://numpy.org), [Scientific Python](https://scipy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), see [this tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

3. For a more detailed introduction to the abovementioned topics, see [Scientific Python Lectures](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures).

4. In case you cannot install python locally on your computer, you may run this notebook online through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by copy-pasting the python code into a colab notebook.
